The task at hand is quite difficult: A ls -R | wc -l reaveals 73k songs to
be classified into 101 labels (not all non-empty). I will attempt some manual
data engineering by removing false genres: e.g. 'english' or 'french', or
genres that are too similar - although one could speculate that learning to
discern between sub-genres might prove quite useful due to the implied difficulty
that has to be overcame.

  - indian: Unique instruments present. Nice edge case? But genres insider are messy: identified EDM, jazz, pop
  - rockabilly: precursor of rock; might prove distinctive enough
